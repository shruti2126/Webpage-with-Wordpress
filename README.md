# Webpage-with-bootstrap
This is a dummy webpage created using components of the bootrap 5 library. 
I have used the jumbotron class for the introduction, the navbar class for the top bar and the card class for the middle section. 
I have primarily used CSS, HTML and JQuery to create this page.
The "AppLandingPage.html is the file you need to open in your browser to view the page. Or you can simply download the zip folder onto your system, extract files and open the html page in your browser.
